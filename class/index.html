        <h2>Welcome!</h2>

          <p>GitHub is an online project-hosting network that helps you seemlessly build software and share it.</p>

          <p>Atom is a modern text-editor that makes it easy and fun to create websites and other web technologies using languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

          <p>GitHub Desktop is a desktop application that bridges Atom and GitHub together. By creating an account with GitHub, anyone can create, sync, change, and post their website live!</p>

          <p>The First step is creating a Repository in GitHub, creating a web page, making edits and changes in Atom, using the GitHub Desktop application to sync your changes to GitHub, and connect your web page live online.</p>
