    <p> write a quick summary of how Github and github desktop and atom work together</p>

    GitHub is an online project-hosting network that helps you seemlessly build software and share it.

    Atom is a modern text-editor that makes it easy and fun to create websites and other web technologies using languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    GitHub Desktop is a desktop application that bridges Atom and GitHub together. By creating an account with GitHub, anyone can create, sync, change, and post their website live!

    The First step is creating a Repository in GitHub, creating a web page, making edits and changes in Atom, using the GitHub Desktop application to sync your changes to GitHub, and connect your web page live online.
